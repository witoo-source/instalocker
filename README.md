# Valorant INSTALOCKER (WORKING)

## What's is this about?
- Well, you've probably know about instalocking, that thing people make to select the agent before anyone. Okay, you can take this to another level using this tool. You just have to press the agent in my app once "Match Found" is shown in valorant, jus that. Easy, right?

## How does it work?
- The program is made in electron, using the Riot in-game API, i get your account access token using the Riot's authentication portal, which is, basically, the log-in screen you use every time to log-in into Riot Game's services. I don't steel your password, don't worry. I get the token using the url that riot provides once you've already logged in. To make it easier an safe to you, i use a WebView to render the riot's login page.

## Can i get banned?
- Probably not. You are not cheating anything, just using an API, but dont be dumb, dont abuse this, just use in your own responsability and try to don't use everytime, just that.
